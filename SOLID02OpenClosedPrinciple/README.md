The Open-closed Princple (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

The risk of changing an existing class is that you will introduce an inadvertent change in behaviour.
The solution is create another class that overrides the behaviour of the original class.
By following the OCP, a component is more likely to contain maintainable and re-usable code.
