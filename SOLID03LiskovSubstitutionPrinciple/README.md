The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Child classes should never break the parent class’ type definitions.

The concept of this principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote and later published in a paper together with Jeannette Wing in 1994.

As simple as that, a subclass should override the parent class methods in a way that does not break functionality from a client’s point of view.
